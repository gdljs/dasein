# Contributing to Dasein

At this moment this is a pet project and not really thought out a lot,
it may not be that active. I really appreciate any contribution.

## The objective of dasein

The main objective of dasein is to create a social network that
experiments with some concepts of interaction. At the moment it focuses
on building ephemeral content that adapts to the conversation. However,
in the future I'd like this to be a space to explore:

	* Dealing with negative behavior
	* Automatic Audience Selection
	* Privacy protection
	* Any feature that might improve on how we connect with others.

## How to contribute

Above All: Be nice, always.

* Ensure the linter shows no warnings or errors
* Don't break the CI
* Make the PRs according to [Git Flow][gitflow]: (features go to
  develop, hotfixes go to master)
